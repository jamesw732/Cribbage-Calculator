# Cribbage-Calculator
Calculates the points of a hand in the card game Cribbage, and provides statistics such as highest possible points for a hand, average points for a hand, etc. Also provides some information on crib points, however this analysis is heavily limited since I assume a normal distribution of cards entering the crib by the opponent (qualitatively, we'd expect that an opponent is less likely to throw a 5 to the crib than a king if they aren't the dealer, however this program does not capture this at all). Computing the same statistics with a non-normal distribution of cards would be reasonable as long as I had significant data on crib passes, however I am uncertain if this exists, and collecting it myself would require an unreasonable amount of cribbage games, and not to mention the data would vary based on player skill.
