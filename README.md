# Cribbage-Calculator
Calculates the points of a hand in the card game Cribbage, and provides statistics such as highest possible points for a hand, average points for a hand, etc. Also provides some information on crib points, however this analysis is heavily limited since I assume a normal distribution of cards entering the crib by the opponent (an opponent will rarely pass a 5 to the crib if they're not the dealer, for example). Computing these statistics with a non-normal distribution of cards would be reasonable, however I am uncertain if data on this exists, and collecting that data myself is not something I am interested in doing.
